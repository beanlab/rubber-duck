        Firstly, as `calculate_score()` returns a score for each student, there should
        be the same number of elements in "all_calculated_up" and "names".


        Currently, you''re trying to zip a list containing one name `names = [line[0][0]]`

        one name gets printed.


        Instead, let''s change this approach by first creating a list of all names,
        then zipping this list with `all_calculated_up`. What do you think about this?

        `calculate_score()` function. Each string in this list corresponds to a calculated
        score for a student.


        The issue is likely with how the `names` list is being constructed in your
        `main()` function. You''re finding the names inside the loop iterating over
        `main_string` but you''re trying to zip them with `all_calculated_up` within
        the same loop.


        A potential fix would be collecting all the names in a list first, and then
        after the loop, zip that list with `all_calculated_up`. This will ensure you''re
