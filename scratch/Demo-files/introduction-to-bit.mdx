# Introduction to Bit

<YouTube id="wR0gNxW5oHA" />

For the first part of the course we will be using Bit, a character that you will
move around a world. Bit is depicted as a triangle:

![bit, a triangle](/images/guide/bit/bit.png)

and his world is a grid of squares:

![a 5 x 3 blank world of white squares](/images/guide/bit/hello-bit.start.png)

Think of Bit as a robot that you control by writing and running code.

## Basic things Bit can do

Some of the things Bit can do are:

- `move` -- one square at a time
- `left` -- turn left
- `right` -- turn right
- `paint` -- change the color of a square

To illustrate how Bit works, here is a short Bit program:

```python
from byubit import Bit


@Bit.empty_world(5, 3)
def move_around(bit):
    bit.move()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("red")

    bit.left()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("green")

    bit.right()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("blue")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    move_around(Bit.new_bit)

```

We will explain all this code shortly, but for now, focus on these lines:

- `bit.move()` -- moves bit one square to the right
- `bit.left()` -- turns bit to the left
- `bit.right()` -- turns bit to the right
- `bit.paint("red")` -- paints the current square red

Each of these commands is a **function** that you are calling. Every time you
call a function you use parentheses: `()`. Inside the parentheses are the
**arguments** or **parameters** for the function.

The `move()`, `left()` and `right()` functions do not take any arguments. The
`paint()` function takes one argument -- the name of a color.

Bit understands three colors:

- `"red"`
- `"green"`
- `"blue"`

These must be in double quotes or single quotes.

## Running Bit on your own

To get some practice running Bit, create a folder in your `cs110`
project called `bit`. You can do this in PyCharm by right-clicking on the
`cs110` folder and selecting `New➡️Directory`:

![pycharm new directory](/images/guide/bit/pycharm-new-directory.png)

Then create a new file in this folder called `hello_bit.py`. You can do this by
right-clicking on the `bit` folder and selecting `New➡️File`:

![pycharm new file](/images/guide/bit/pycharm-new-file.png)

Then copy and paste this code into the `hello_bit.py` file you created:

```python
from byubit import Bit


@Bit.empty_world(5, 3)
def move_around(bit):
    bit.move()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("red")

    bit.left()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("green")

    bit.right()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("blue")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    move_around(Bit.new_bit)

```

You should end up with a file like this:

![pycharm hello bit](/images/guide/bit/pycharm-hello-bit.png)

### Running the program

Click the green triangle next to the line of code that starts with `if`:

![pycharm running hello bit](/images/guide/bit/bit-running-a-program.png)

We will explain this below. Here is what it looks like in PyCharm:

![pycharm running hello bit](/images/guide/bit/pycharm-run-hello-bit.png)

Here is what you should see:

![hello bit finishing world](/images/guide/bit/bit-hello-world-screen.png)

This shows that bit moved through the world and painted some squares.

Use these buttons to "replay" what Bit did:

- `First` -- moves back to the first line of code
- `Prev` -- moves back one line of code
- `Next` -- moves forward one line of code
- `Last` -- moves to the last line of code

As you move, the top part of the world will tell you which line of code Python
is running.

and select `Run 'hello_bit'`. You should see what we showed you above:

![hello bit finishing world](/images/guide/bit/bit-hello-world-screen.png)

## Problems?

If this code is not running properly, this means you must have missed a step when [creating your PyCharm project](/guide/getting-started/creating-a-pycharm-project). You should revisit this and get help from a TA as needed.

## Explaining the rest of this code

Let's go through this code line by line.

### Line 1

Whenever you write a program that uses Bit, you need to start with this line:

```python
from byubit import Bit
```

This is a way of telling Python that you want to use the `byubit` library that
you installed. You will use `Bit` with a capital `B` for special commands
telling the library what to do.

### Lines 4 to 16

Lines 4 to 16 contain a **function** called `move_around()`:

```python
@Bit.empty_world(5, 3)
def move_around(bit):
    bit.move()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("red")

    bit.left()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("green")

    bit.right()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint("blue")
```

- 4: `@Bit.empty_world(5, 3)` -- This is a **decorator** that tells `Bit` to
  start in an empty world that is `5` squares wide and `3` squaers tall.

- 5: `def move_around(bit):` -- This is a **function definition**. Everything we
  will do this semester will involve writing Python functions.

- 6 to 16 -- This is the **function body**. The function body will be run every
  time you call the function.

A function has five parts to it:

![function definition](/images/guide/bit/functions.png)

1. The `def` keyword tells Python you are defining a function.

1. The function name tells Python how someone can call this function. Here we
   have given the function the name `move_around()`.

1. The function arguments are listed in parentheses. Here we tell Python this
   function takes one argument, `(bit)`.

1. The function definition ends with a colon `:`.

1. The function body is the list of commands you will run when the function is
   called. These are indented and the indentation is _very_ important. Every
   line in the function body must be indented the same amount. The usual
   indentation is four spaces.

### Lines 19 and 20

Lines 19 and 20 contain the **main block** of the Python program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    move_around(Bit.new_bit)
```

Every program has to start somewhere. In Python, we call this the _main block_.
This is where Python starts when it runs your code. Python will put a green
triangle to the left of your main block so that you can click on it to run your
program.

In this main block, we have one line of code:

```python
move_around(Bit.new_bit)
```

Here we are _calling_ the `move_around()` function. We have to give it a bit,
and we do this by saying `Bit.new_bit`. This creates a new bit to live in the
world.

## Defining versus calling a function

When we _define_ a function with `def`, we are telling Python what a function
means. For example, when we defined `move_around()` we told Python this means
_move Bit two squares, turn left, move another square, paint red_, and so forth.

When we _call_ a function, we are telling Python to run all of the code in the
function definition. This is when Python will actually run all of the code that
tells Bit what to do.

![calling a function](/images/guide/bit/calling-a-function.png)

## Blank lines

Python needs blank lines to separate pieces of the code. The convention is to
use two blank lines between every piece. If you do not follow this convention,
PyCharm will complain by putting a squiggly line underneath the line that
doesn't have enough blank lines before it.

![pycharm complaint about not enough blank lines](/images/guide/bit/pycharm-complaint-blank-lines.png)

Add an extra blank line and the warning will go away.
