        \ `#include<list>`. \n\nTo declare a list, use `std::list<data_type> list_name;`.\
        \ \n\nTo add elements, you can use `list_name.push_back(value);` to add at\
        \ end, or `list_name.push_front(value);` to add at beginning.\n\nTo remove\
        \ elements, `list_name.pop_back();` removes from end, and `list_name.pop_front();`\
        \ removes from the start. \n\nTo traverse a list, you can use iterators as\
        \ `std::list<data_type>::iterator it;` and loop with `for(it=list_name.begin();\
        \ it!=list_name.end(); it++)`.\n\nCan you provide more details about your\

        \ return an iterator pointing to the end of the list. Example usage:\n\n```cpp\n\

        \ If you only want to convert specific rows, you can decide when to call `convert_row_type`\
