        Now, can you tell me which parts of these two functions - `count_appearances`
        and `copy_file` - seem unclear to you or might not behave as expected?'},
    {user: 'um neither? the program passes all the doctests'}, {assistant: 'Great!
        So, it seems you understand these code snippets well. Is there anything else
        you''d like to discuss or need assistance with?'}, {user: 'well the doctests
        within the program file work, but when uploaded, the autograder online has
        trouble accessing the file'}, {assistant: 'Access issues might be related
        to file paths or permissions. Can you verify the path and accessibility of
        the file you''re trying to upload? Is the file in the same directory as your
        python script?'}, {user: 'how do i check that?'}, {assistant: 'In your Python
        script, you can use the `os` module to get the current working directory which
        is the location where your Python script is running. The command is:

        ```python

        import os

        print(os.getcwd())

        ```

        Run this in your script to see the directory. Then, verify that your file
        exists in this directory. If not, you need to provide the correct path to
        the file.'}, {user: it won't accept that command because the whole program
        is a doctest}, {assistant: 'In that case, please ensure that the input file
        ''text.txt'' is in the same directory as the Python script and both files
        are in the same directory as the autograder. You may also try providing the
        full path to ''text.txt'' in your code if it''s in a different directory.'},
    {user: it keeps endlessly running the tests even though it says the program passed
        all the test}, {assistant: "If you're sure the code is accurate and correctly\
        \ addressing all test cases, the issue may be with the autograder itself,\
        \ such as a bug in its loop that checks the code, or a server issue. \n\n\
        I recommend reaching out to your course instructor or TA, explaining clearly\
        \ what you are experiencing, and ask for their guidance. They are familiar\
        \ with the autograder system and can give you the most accurate advice."},
    {user: why does it say "test IDs can't be resolved"}, {assistant: 'That message
        usually appears when the test identifier you''ve specified doesn''t match
        any tests that the autograder can find. Are you sure the test identifiers
        you''re using are correct? They must match exactly with those predefined in
        the autograder. Double check spelling, capitalization, and any special characters.'}]}
