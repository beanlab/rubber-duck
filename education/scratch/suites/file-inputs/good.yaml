        \ part of the string. For example:\n\n```cpp\nstd::string str = \"123.45000\"\
        ;\nsize_t endPos = str.find_last_not_of(\"0\"); // Find the last position\
        \ where '0' is not found\nif (str[endPos] == '.') // If last character is\

        \ endPos + 1); // Remove the trailing zeroes\n```\n\nIn these lines, `str`\
        \ starts as \"123.45000\". `find_last_not_of` returns the position of '5',\
        \ since this is the last position where '0' is not found. We then check if\
        \ this last character is a dot. If not, we need to get rid of it as well.\
        \ Finally, `substr` is used to create a new string from position 0 to `endPos`.\

        you `[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]`. Each tuple consists of an element from `a`
        and an element from `b`.


        To convert each tuple to a nested list, you use `list()`. Thus, `[list(item)

        \ on your dictionary, `newDict`.\n2. `i` is the key we're looking for in the\
        \ dictionary. It's the current integer from your list.\n3. If `i` exists in\
        \ `newDict`, `get(i, 0)` returns the value associated with `i`.\n4. If `i`\
        \ does not exist in `newDict`, `get(i, 0)` returns `0` - the default value\
        \ we've provided after the comma.\n5. In the line `newDict[i] = newDict.get(i,\
        \ 0) + 1`, we're essentially saying \"set the value of `i` in 'newDict' to\
        \ be one more than its current value\". If `i` doesn't exist yet, it's instead\
        \ set to `1` (since `0 + 1 = 1`). \n\nSo `get(i, 0)` helps us retrieve a current\
