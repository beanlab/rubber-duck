## What I Learned ##
+ Read from the Tar Pit, liked learning about the distinction between accidental and inherent complexity
+ I learned I still hate setting up more than any other coding practice than I've encountered
## What I Accomplished ##
+ (I think) I'm all set up with clean conda enviroments for the class, and for the skillathon bot
+ Done some poking around OpenAI and Discord to get familiar with the settings
+ Started to set up the Skillathon bot
+ Familiarized myself with the rubberduck code
## Challenges I Faced ##
+ Getting Conda installed, couldn't get it to work, uninstalled and and got the then reinstallled to try again
+ Remembering how to use Git, getting stuck figuring out how to push updates, and trying to figure out why my machine has updates files I didn't touch, being unable to pull, etc...
+ Trying to figure out how close I am to getting the bot figured out, what code to put in and where
## Blockers ##
+ Once I was added to the server for the skill bot and got the auth token for openai, nothing yet
