# Wiley Welch #
## What I Learned ##
+ I learned more about discord and how to edit and change threads.
+ I learned more about how rubber_duck.py works.
## What I Accomplished ##
+ We were able to set up a TA review channel.
+ We were able to gather data from the TA's rating the conversations.
+ We were able to set up this weekly_updates folder
## Challenges I Faced ##
+ Remembering what Professor Bean wanted us to work on.
## Blockers ##
+ **External:** CS 312 homework, sickness, and car troubles made it hard to find time to work on the project.
+ **Internal:** analyzing the code was tricky but still interesting.

## Bryce Martin ##
## What I Learned ##
+ I learned about the different IDs that discord uses, and figured how to make links with them that we could use
+ I learned how we could go about detecting if a conversation has changed tone and we can prompt them for a different thread
+ Internalized better how metrics, feedback, history, and state are stored
## What I Accomplished ##
+ I read through the discord init and Client function, have a better understanding as to what's under the hood
+ We got the TA channel to get pinged every time a thread finished up with a link to it
## Challenges I Faced ##
+ Only being able to see functionality work when doing 'Code with me' with Wiley (he has been great about setting up times to meet though)
+ Distinguishing the main purpose between the discord and rubber duck py files, the feedback/metric separations make more sense to me
## Blockers ##
+ I can't figure out why my chatbot doesn't work, even after reading up on it
