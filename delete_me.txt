Your `removeNode` function along with `minValueNode` forms the core logic for removing a node from the AVL tree, accounting for the cases of
the node having no children, one child, or two children. However, the balancing logic post-removal tha
t ensures the tree maintains its AVL properties (balancing) after the node has been removed is missing. This is crucial for an AVL tree implementation.

Here's what needs to be added or confirmed:

### Rebalancing Logic

After updating the height of the current node, you correctly calculate the balance factor (`balance = getBalance(node);`). Next, you need to perform checks for unbalancing and apply necessary rotations, similar to those in the insertion process but considering all four cases of imbalance:

1. **Left Left Case**
   - If the balance is greater than 1 and the balance of the left child is greater than or equal to 0, apply a right rotation on the current node.

2. **Left Right Case**
   - If the balance is greater than 1 and the balance of the left child is less than 0, first perform a left rotation on the left child, then a right rotation on the current node.

3. **Right Right Case**
   - If the balance is less than -1 and the balance of the right child is less than or equal to 0, apply a left rotation on the current node.

4. **Right Left Case**
   - If the balance is less than -1 and the balance of the right child is greater than 0, first perform a right rotation on the right child, then a left rotation on the current node.

### Sample Rebalancing Addition to Your Code

```cpp
// Begin rebalancing logic
if (balance > 1 && getBalance(node->left) >= 0) {
    return rightRotate(node);
}

if (balance > 1 && getBalance(node->left) < 0) {
    node->left = leftRotate(node->left);
    return rightRotate(node);
}

if (balance < -1 && getBalance(node->right) <= 0) {
    return leftRotate(node);
}

if (balance < -1 && getBalance(node->right) > 0) {
    node->right = rightRotate(node->right);
    return leftRotate(node);
}
// End rebalancing logic
```

### Final Thoughts

Ensure the rebalancing code is included after updating the node's height in the `removeNode` function to correctly maintain AVL tree balance after deletions. Remember, balancing AVL trees isn't just about applying rotations but also correctly determining when and which rotation is appropriate to preserve the AVL property.

With these rebalancing steps included and correctly implemented, your `removeNode` function would indeed be correct and complete for maintaining an AVL tree upon node deletions.
