## Stretch 1

===
- Design Experience:
    - State your discussion partner
    - Provide a brief summary of your conversation
- Alignment Scores:
    - Include the scores you found for each sequence
    - Who opened the lock to the enclosure (The correct answer is rat)

## Stretch 2

===
- Design Experience:
    - State your discussion partner
    - Provide a brief summary of your conversation
- Alignment Outcome Comparisons:
    - Briefly discuss the differences in alignment outcomes between using and not using affine penalties
    - Compare alignment outcomes by selecting a set of alignment sequences, including the sequences and their alignments, and what parameters were used to find the alignments. Discusses how the parameters were selected.
