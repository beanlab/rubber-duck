Common Setting:
     &single_problem_requirements
     -  Solve the problem and pass all the LeetCode tests for the problem
     -  Include submission link
     -  Include snapshot of your submission in LeetCode. (Must include your username, the problem name, and the passed status.)
     - Theoretical time:
        -  Include annotated code in report
        -  Annotate all non-trivial parts of your code
        -  Provide explanation of time complexity
        -  State all assumptions clearly
        -  Bold final time complexity
     - Theoretical space:
        -  Include annotated code in report
        -  Annotate all non-trivial parts of your code
        -  Provide explanation of space complexity
        -  State all assumptions clearly
        -  Bold final space complexity
