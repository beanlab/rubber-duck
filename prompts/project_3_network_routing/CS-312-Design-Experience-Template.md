## 1. Problem Understanding

- **What is the problem?**  
  _Write a clear description of the problem you're solving._
```
# Write answer here
```


- **How does your algorithm solve this problem?**  
  _Summarize the approach or strategy behind your solution._
```
# Write answer here
```

---

## 2.  Algorithmic Steps

- **Describe the step-by-step process of your algorithm:**
  _Use clear and ordered steps from start to finish._

```
Example:
1. Initialize result array.
2. Iterate through input list.
3. Apply transformation logic to each element.
4. Return the result array.
5. (Continue)
```

- **If you are using multiple versions (variants) of the algorithm:**  
  _Describe the alternate steps between them. Use numbered steps._

```
# Write answer here
```

---

## 3. Data Structures

- **Which data structures are you using?**  
  _List them and explain why they’re appropriate._

```
# Write answer here
```


- **What are the pros and cons of your data structure choices?**

```
Example:
- Using a hash map for O(1) lookups.
- Downside: extra memory usage.
```

- **Write key sub-methods or helper functions in pseudocode (Python-style):**

```python
"""
Record all of your key functions here in pseudocode. 
""" 
def example_function(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for elem in arr:
        if elem > max_val:
            max_val = elem
    return max_val
```
