Given this, the instructions for homework-1a are as follows:

1. Fix me
You are given some code in fix_me.py. Bit starts from a blank 5x3 world:

-----
-----
-----
0 0
0

The starting code for the problem to fix is this:

from byubit import Bit


@Bit.worlds('fix-me')
def fix_me(bit):
    bit.paint('green')
    bit.move()
    bit.paint('green')
    bit.move()
    bit.right()
    bit.paint('green')
    bit.move()
    bit.paint('blue')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    fix_me(Bit.new_bit)



Bit should finish with a world that looks like this:

-----
--b--
ggg--
2 1
1

Run the code in fix-me.py. It will finish with a comparison error. Fix the error so the code runs correctly.

2. Fix me too!
You are given some code in fix_me_too.py. Bit starts from a blank 5x3 world:

-----
-----
-----
0 0
0

The starting code for the world is this:

from byubit import Bit


@Bit.worlds('fix-me-too')
def do_more_fixing(bit):
    bit.move
    bit.paint('blue')
    bit.move()
    bit.paint('blue')
    bit.move()
    bit.left()
    bit.move()
    bit.paint(green)
    bit.left
    bit.move()
    bit.move()
    bit.right()
    bit.move()
    bit.pain('red')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    do_more_fixing(Bit.new_bit)



Bit should finish with a world that looks like this:

-----
r--g-
-br--
0 1
2

Run the code in fix-me-too.py. It will show an error in the terminal. Fix the error so the code runs correctly.

Note: there are multiple errors in this file

3. Make me smile
You are given some starter code in make-me-smile.py. Bit starts from a 7x6 world with just some eyes:

-------
-b---b-
-------
-------
-------
-------
0 0
1


Bit should finish with a world that has a completed smile:

-------
-b---b-
-------
-b---b-
--bbb--
-------
5 2
1


Write code in make-me-smile.py to complete the smile.

Note: you need the correct finishing position and direction for Bit as well!

4. Picasso
Now it‚Äôs your turn! Write a script called picasso.py that draws whatever you want.

Follow the pattern we used in Lab 1a, Exercise 1, which shows how to start from an empty world. Use a world of size 8x8.

You can call your function anything you want, but a good name is picasso :-)

üßëüèº‚Äçüé®

Rules:

you have to move/turn/paint at least 20 times

This ends the instructions for homework-1a.
