Here are the instructions for the given homework assignment:

# Homework 4b - Substrings

## 1. Practice Problems

In `practice_problems.py` you will find the stubs of several functions, along
with documentation that explains what each function should do:

- `for_reals(text)` -- Replace all '%' with ' percent' and all '!' with ' (for
  reals).' Notice there are spaces in these.

- `doubles(text)` -- Replace all "oo" with "oooooo" and all "ee" with "eeeeee".

- `upper_vowels(text)` -- Make all vowels uppercase.

- `only_o(text)` -- Replace all vowels (aeiou) with 'o', preserving the casing
  of each letter.

You should implement all of these. There are tests provided.

You may write additional functions in the file as needed.

## 2. Reverse Wordle

Write a program that:

1. Prompts the person for a string of characters to block out
2. Prompts the person for a replacement character
3. Prompts the person for a sequence of inputs
   - Replace all blocked characters in the input with the replacement character

Match the prompts and formatting from the example.

**Example**

```
Characters to block: blocked
Replacement: *
Word: fish
fish
Word: book
****
Word: CHOOSE
*H**S*
Word:

```

## 3. Out of Stock

Write a program that:

1. Using a sequence of inputs, prompt the person for a list of out-of-stock
   items
2. Using a sequence of inputs, prompt the person for the items they would like
   to purchase
   - If the item is out-of-stock, inform the person
   - Otherwise add it to the list of items requested
3. Print the available items the person indicated they want to purchase

Match the prompts and formatting from the example.

**Example**

```
What items are out of stock?
Item: toilet paper
Item: eggs
Item:
What items would you like to purchase?
Item: tuna
Item: eggs
I'm sorry, the item EGGS is out of stock.
Item: spinach
Item:
You have 2 items:
- tuna
- spinach
```

## Tests

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.
