Here are the instructions for the given homework assignment:

# Homework 4a -- Strings

> Once again, before running the tests we provide, you will need to upgrade the
> `byu-pytest-utils` package. Read the
> [guide on upgrading a package](/guide/unit3/upgrading-a-package) to do this.
> You will want at least version `0.5.0`

## 1. Practice Problems

In `practice_problems.py` you will find the stubs of several functions, along
with documentation that explains what each function should do. You should
implement all of these. 

There are tests provided; looking at the input and output in ```test_practice_problems``` could be helpful.

### Tips for ```keep_big_words``` and ```most_punctuation```
The parameter "words" refers to a list of strings. A word in words could be a string such as "I appreciate your thoughtfulness." All you need to count is the number of punctuation marks or uppercase letters which are in the string as a whole.

Writing additional functions, such as one that finds the number of uppercase letters in a string, is recommended.


## 2. BYU Students

Write a program that asks for a list of students.

Each student has _name_, _hometown_, and _school_.

When a person enters nothing for the name, the list is complete.

Then:

- Print out all the names of students from BYU in ALL CAPS.
- Print out all the names of students from other schools.

Match the prompts and formatting from the following example:

```text
Enter a student.
Name: Eliza Snow
Hometown: Becket
School: BYU
Enter a student.
Name: George Smith
Hometown: Provo
School: UVU
Enter a student.
Name:
BYU Students:
- ELIZA SNOW
Other Students:
- George Smith
```

You can find starter code in `students.py`.

## Tests

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.

## Grading

| Activity          | Points |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Practice problems | 10     |
| BYU Students      | 10     |

Manual grading will focus on decomposition, fluency, and appropriate management of strings.
