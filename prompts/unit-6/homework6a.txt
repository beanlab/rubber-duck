Here are the instructions for the given homework assignment:


# Homework 6a -- Mutability

## 1. Better Word Count

Write a program in `better_word_count.py` that takes one argument:

- an input file name

and prints out a dictionary showing how many words of each word length were
found. The program provides counts for all word lengths from 1 to 20.

We have provided you with an example file in `words.txt`:

```
cat catch snooze seven pearl
concatenate silliness you
fireplace it cornered me
```

When you run the program, it should create this output:

```
python solutions/better_word_count.py words.txt
{1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 3, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 2, 10: 0, 11: 1, 12: 0, 13: 0, 14: 0, 15: 0, 16: 0, 17: 0, 18: 0, 19: 0, 20: 0}
```

We have also given you some text in `1Nephi.txt` that you can use as a test
file.

**Tip**

- Consider using `range()` to create keys for the dictionary and set the initial
  counts to zero.

- Remember to strip punctuation, specifically ```'.,;:!?()'```. This is needed to pass the test cases.

## 2. Picture Board

Write a program in `picture_board.py` that lets you put emojis into a picture
board. The picture board has 5 available positions (identified by the indexes
0-4). The program should:

- display the pictures
- prompt you for a slot and picture
- update the picture board

This repeats until you enter an empty string for the slot.

Follow this input and output carefully:

```
['', '', '', '', '']

Slot: 0
Pic: ⭐️
['⭐️', '', '', '', '']

Slot: 3
Pic: 🦆
['⭐️', '', '', '🦆', '']

Slot: 2
Pic: 🐟
['⭐️', '', '🐟', '🦆', '']

Slot: 0
Pic: 🚗
['🚗', '', '🐟', '🦆', '']

Slot:
```

**Tip**

Consider initializing your board (using a list) before your input loop:

```python
pics = ['', '', '', '', '']
```

## Tests

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.

## Grading

| Activity          | Points |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Better word count | 10     |
| Picture board     | 10     |

Manual grading will focus on decomposition, fluency, and use of mutable lists and dictionaries.
