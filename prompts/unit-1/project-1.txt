Given this, the instructions for project 1 are as follows:


1. Y
Draw two Ys. Bit starts in this world:

--------------
--------------
--------------
--------------
--------------
--------------
--------------
0 5
0


Bit should finish in a world that looks like this:

--------------
b---b--b---b--
-b-b----b-b---
--b------b----
--b------b----
--b------b----
--------------
13 5
0


Be sure you have Bitâ€™s position and direction correct as well!

2. Go Go Go
Bit starts in a world like this:

----g-----
----------
----------
----------
----b---r-
----------
0 5
0

Help Bit follow these instructions:

paint green until the green square, then turn right
paint blue until the blue square, then turn left
paint red until the red square
When Bit is done, the world should look like this:

ggggg-----
----b-----
----b-----
----b-----
----brrrr-
----------
8 1
0

3. Grassy Field
Fill the field with grass! Bit starts in a world like this:

----
----
----
----
0 0
0

When Bit is done, the world should look like this:

gggg
gggg
gggg
gggg
3 0
0

Note: the world can be any size. The optimal solution to this would be to create a function that would paint a column and then return to the bottom, then move on to the next column.

4. Banner
Bit starts in a world like this:

g---g
-g-g-
--g--
-----
-----
-----
0 0
0

In each column, paint red up to and including the green square.

The solution to this problem is very similar to the solution to Grassy Field. Instead of moving until Bit is blocked, what should Bit do instead?

When Bit is finished, the world should look like this:

r---r
rr-rr
rrrrr
rrrrr
rrrrr
rrrrr

Keep in mind, each of these problems has 2 separate bit worlds that will be tested on. Solutions need to be able to use while loops effectively in order to pass both worlds.
