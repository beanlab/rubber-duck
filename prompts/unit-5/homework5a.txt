Here are the instructions for the given homework assignment:


# Homework 5a -- Dictionaries

## 1. Postal routing

Write a program in `postal_routing.py` that sorts mail into bins. This program
takes two arguments on the command line:

- an input file of addresses
- an output file

An example of the input file is in `addresses.txt`:

```
9927 Giffin Ct, Windermere, FL 34786
221B Baker St., London 5208
350 Fifth Avenue, New York City, NY 10118
62 West Wallaby Street, Wigan, Lancashire 227
17 Cherry Tree Lane, London 5208
```

You are given a dictionary that maps zip codes to bins:

```python
zip_code_to_delivery_bin = {
        5208: 16,
        10118: 4,
        227: 76,
        12345: 1,
        84604: 25,
        84602: 25,
        20895: 82
    }
```

Your program should go through each address in the input file, one by one, find
the zip code, and then map that zip code to its bin. The program should write
the bins, one per line to the output file. If no bin is found the program should
write "unknown" for that line.

Given the above dictionary, if you run the program:

```
python postal_routing.py addresses.txt bins.txt
```

then the file `bins.txt` should contain:

```
unknown
16
4
76
16
```

We have given you starter code in `postal_routing.py`.

## 2. Autocorrect

Write a program in `auto_correct.py` that automatically corrects words. This
program takes two arguments on the command line:

- an input file of text
- an output file

An example of the input file is in `"sloppy.txt`:

```
i saw yuo adn the dog at teh park
did you see what thye were doing there
```

You are given a dictionary that maps incorrect words to correct words:

```
corrections = {
        'teh': 'the',
        'adn': 'and',
        'thye': 'they',
        'yuo': 'you',
        'i': 'I'
    }
```

Your program should go through each word in every line of the input file, find
any words in the `corrections` dictionary, and then map those words to their
correct word. The program should write the corrected lines to the output file.

Given the above dictionary, if you run the program:

```
python auto_correct.py sloppy.txt neat.txt
```

then the file `neat.txt` should contains:

```
I saw you and the dog at the park
did you see what they were doing there
```

We have given you starter code in `auto_correct.py`.

## Tests

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.

## Grading

| Activity       | Points |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Postal routing | 10     |
| Autocorrect    | 10     |

Manual grading will focus on decomposition, fluency, and use of dictionaries.
