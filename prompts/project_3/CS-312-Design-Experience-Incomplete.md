# Algorithm Design Worksheet

Use this worksheet to guide your thinking as you design and analyze your algorithm. Be thorough in each section and support your reasoning with clear logic and evidence.

---

## 1. Problem Understanding

- **What is the problem?**  
  _Write a clear description of the problem you're solving._

```
IDK
```

- **How does your algorithm solve this problem?**  
  _Summarize the approach or strategy behind your solution._

```
IDK
```

---

## 2. Algorithmic Steps

- **Describe the step-by-step process of your algorithm:**  
  _Use clear and ordered steps from start to finish._
```
We will use Dijkstra’s Algorithm
```
**If you are using multiple versions (variants) of the algorithm:**  
_Describe the alternate steps between them. Use numbered steps._
```
the steps the same.
```
---

## 3. Data Structures

- **Which data structures are you using?**  
  _List them and explain why they’re appropriate._

- **What are the pros and cons of your data structure choices?**
```  
pro: the program works
con: the program is slow
```

**Write key sub-methods or helper functions in pseudocode (Python-style):**

---
```python
# Heap Class Submethods
def heapify_up(self, index):
    pass

def heapify_down(self, index):
    pass

def insert(self, item):
    pass

def decrease_key(self, item, new_val):
    pass

def delete_min(self):
    pass

```
