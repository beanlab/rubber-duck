# Context

## Project Context
Background
The convex hull of a set Q of points is the smallest convex polygon P for which each point in Q is either on the boundary of P or in its interior.

To be rigorous, a polygon is a piecewise-linear, closed curve in the plane. That is, it is a curve ending on itself that is formed by a sequence of straight-line segments, called the sides of the polygon. A point joining two consecutive sides is called a vertex of the polygon. If the polygon is simple, as we shall generally assume, it does not cross itself. The set of points in the plane enclosed by a simple polygon forms the interior of the polygon, the set of points on the polygon itself forms its boundary, and the set of points surrounding the polygon forms its exterior. A simple polygon is convex if, given any two points on its boundary or in its interior, all points on the line segment drawn between them are contained in the polygon's boundary or interior.



Applications
More generally beyond two dimensions, the convex hull for a set of points Q in a real vector space V is the minimal convex set containing Q.

Algorithms for some other computational geometry problems start by computing a convex hull. Consider, for example, the two-dimensional farthest-pair problem: we are given a set of n points in the plane and wish to find the two points whose distance from each other is maximum. This pair is also referred to as the diameter of the set of points. You can prove that these two points must be vertices of the convex hull.

The problem of finding convex hulls also finds its practical applications in pattern recognition, image processing, statistics and GIS.

Divide and Conquer
In the divide-and-conquer method for finding the convex hull,

The set of n points is divided into two subsets, L containing the leftmost ⎡n/2⎤ points and R containing the rightmost ⎣n/2⎦ points.
The convex hulls of the subsets L and R are computed recursively.


Then a clever method is used to combine the hulls:
To merge the left hull LEFT and the right hull RIGHT, it is necessary to find the two edges known as the upper and lower common tangents (shown in red below). A common tangent of two simple convex polygons is a line segment in the exterior of both polygons intersecting each polygon at a single vertex. If continued infinitely in either direction, the common tangent would not intersect the interior of either polygon.
The upper common tangent can be found by scanning around the left hull in a counter-clockwise direction and around the right hull in a clockwise direction. Some guidance with regard to finding the common tangents is given below; although you will need to work out some additional details. The two tangents divide each hull into two pieces. The right edges belonging to the left subset and the left edges belonging to the right subset must be deleted.


The remaining part of the algorithm is a solution for the base case (i.e., the leaves of your recursion). In the example shown above, the final hull appears as follows:



Finding the upper common tangent:

Start with the rightmost point of the left hull and the leftmost point of the right hull
While the edge is not upper tangent to both left and right

While the edge is not upper tangent to the left, move counter-clockwise to the next point on the left hull (Hint: We want to move to the next point(s) on the left hull as long as the slope decreases)
While the edge is not upper tangent to the right, move clockwise to the next point on the right hull


Some Other Hints:

Maintain clockwise (or counter-clockwise) ordering when merging (natural if you start that way). Note below that from one point (e.g. left-most) to each other point, clockwise order will be by decreasing slopes.



Note that you can handle the two base cases (n = 2, and n = 3) by appropriately ordering those simple hulls. But, you can also have a single base case with n = 1, if you are careful with how you merge hulls, and this might be easier/more elegant.

You need to be careful when accessing your hull data structure since it is really a circular list. If using an array then make sure indexes properly change between the 0 element and the last element when you are moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise through the array.

## Instructions to the student
Instructions
Write the full, unambiguous pseudo-code for your divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points Q. Be sure to label the parts of your algorithm. Also, label each part with its worst-case time efficiency.
Analyze the whole algorithm for its worst-case time efficiency. State the Big-O asymptotic bound. Discuss how this relates to the Master Theorem estimate for runtime.
Implement in Python the
 divide-and-conquer algorithm we presented in class and in the slides. Comment appropriate parts with their time efficiency.

Implement your algorithm in convex_hull::compute_hull. Add additional classes and methods as needed.
Use the divide and conquer algorithm from step #1 to find the convex hull of the input points.
You do not need to implement your own sorting algorithm (though you may), but you do need to sort in worst case
 time and discuss this complexity in your complexity discussion below.
Conduct an empirical analysis of your algorithm by running several experiments as follows:

For each value n ∈ {10, 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, 500,000, 1,000,000}

Generate 5 sets of n points (x,y) in the plane. You may use either provided point generator: the 2-D Gaussian (Normal) distribution (use --dist normal) or the uniform distribution (use --dist uniform). For every point, x and y are real numbers (floats).
For each set of points,
find the convex hull
record the elapsed time (shown in the final plot)
For each size n, compute the mean time t required
Plot n (independent variable) versus t (dependent variable). For graphing you may use any resource you want, including a spreadsheet. One of the best tools for graphing is the matplotlib library which you can load for Python.

As a sanity check, typical run times for 1,000,000 points is about 10-15 seconds (wall time) and will differ somewhat based on the speed of your computer. However, if your run-times are significantly slower (e.g more than a couple minutes), then you have probably not implemented the nlogn algorithm correctly and you will lose some points proportional to how much slower you are.
Find the relation of your plot (empirical analysis) to the theoretical nlogn complexity for this algorithm. In other words, if your theoretical analysis says that for a set of n points Q, the convex hull algorithm CH(Q) ∈ O(g(n)), does g(n) actually fit your empirical data? If so, what is the constant of proportionality k so that CH(Q) = k·g(n)? If not, then which function g(n) best fits your empirical data, and what is the constant of proportionality? You can fit a function analytically using software or by trial and error in a spreadsheet, for example.
