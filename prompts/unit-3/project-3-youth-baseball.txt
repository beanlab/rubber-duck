Here are the instructions for the given homework assignment:


# Project 3 - Youth Baseball

For this project, you need to write a program that registers players for
baseball teams in a youth league. There are two teams:

- Bigs -- players over 10 years old
- Littles -- players 10 years and younger

The program should allow you to enter all the players and their ages, then print
out a report on the two teams.

## Registration

The registration program needs two things to register a player:

- name
- age

The program should automatically assign players to the two teams based on their
age.

## Report

For each team, the program prints:

- Total members
- Average age (rounded to zero decimal places)
- Youngest age
- Oldest age
- Members (in a bulleted list)

## Sample Input/Output

Here is some sample input and output:

```
Enter player name: Willie Mays
Enter player age: 10
Enter player name: Mike Trout
Enter player age: 4
Enter player name: Cat Osterman
Enter player age: 13
Enter player name: Jocelyn Alo
Enter player age: 15
Enter player name: Mike Trout
Enter player age: 8
Enter player name: Ted Williams
Enter player age: 9
Enter player name: Dot Richardson
Enter player age: 6

```

## Sample Code

You can find sample code in `youth_baseball.py`.

## Testing

1. You should test your program on your own before you run the tests we provide.

2. When you are ready to run our tests, you will need to upgrade the
   `byu-pytest-utils` package. Read the
   [guide on upgrading a package](/guide/unit3/upgrading-a-package) to do this.

3. When you are ready to submit, use Gradescope. The grader has been setup to
   award partial credit. The points awarded are shown below. In addition, each
   section has partial credit. For example, if you are missing only a space in
   your output, you will get most of the credit.

## Grading

| Activity               | Points             |
