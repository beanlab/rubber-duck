Here are the instructions for the given homework assignment:

# Homework 3b -- Input loops

For all interactive programs, be sure to include a space at the end of the
string you give to `input()`.

For example:

```python
name = input('What is your name? ')
```

Notice the space between the question mark and the quotation mark.

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.

## 1. Words

Write a program in `words.py` that asks a person to guess a word. The program
continually prompts the person to enter a guess until they get it right. When
the person enters a guess, the program checks whether it is alphabetically less
than, equal to, or greater than the correct word. It has these potential
responses:

- Lower!
- Higher!
- You got it!

The file `words.py` contains this sample code:

```
def play(secret_word):
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    play('python')
```

You are welcome to replace the world `python` with any word you like. However,
**when you turn in your assignment**, please make sure `python` is the secret
word.

Here is a sample session of someone guessing a word:

```
Guess a word: slate
Lower!
Guess a word: crane
Higher!
Guess a word: pickles
Higher!
Guess a word: quiz
Lower!
Guess a word: poodle
Higher!
Guess a word: python
You got it!
```

## 2. Calculator

Write a program in `calculator.py` that provides a basic calculator. The program
provides the following menu:

```

What would you like to do?
 1) Add
 2) Subtract
 3) Quit
Option:
```

**Always print a blank line at the start of the menu.**

If a person enters `1`, then prompt for two numbers:

```
Number 1:
Number 2:
```

and print out the result of adding them.

If a person enters `2`, then prompt for two numbers:

```
Number 1:
Number 2:
```

and print out the result of subtracting them.

If a person enters `3`, then quit the program.

If a person enters something other than these three numbers, print:

```
Unrecognized response: [response]
```

The file `calculator.py` has some starting code:

```python
def calculator():
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    calculator()
```

Here is a sample session of someone interacting with the calculator:

```

What would you like to do?
 1) Add
 2) Subtract
 3) Quit
Option: 2
Number 1: 16
Number 2: 7
9

What would you like to do?
 1) Add
 2) Subtract
 3) Quit
Option: 1
Number 1: 91
Number 2: 22
113

What would you like to do?
 1) Add
 2) Subtract
 3) Quit
Option: help
Unrecognized response: help

What would you like to do?
 1) Add
 2) Subtract
 3) Quit
Option: 3
```

## Tests

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.

## Grading

| Activity   | Points |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Words      | 10     |
| Calculator | 10     |

Manual grading will focus on decomposition and fluency.
