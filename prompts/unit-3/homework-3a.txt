Here are the instructions for the given homework assignment:

# Homework 3a -- Interactive Programs

For all interactive programs, be sure to include a space at the end of the
string you give to `input()`.

For example:

```python
name = input('What is your name? ')
```

Notice the space between the question mark and the quotation mark.

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.

## 1. Pizza time

For this problem, write a program that takes a pizza order. The program input
and output should look like this:

```
Welcome to Papa John's!
What is your name? <person enters name>
What kind of pizza do you want? <person enters kind of pizza>
What toppings do you want? <person enters toppings>
<name> wants a <kind> pizza with <toppings>!
```

The starter code is in `pizza_time.py`.

There are tests in `test_pizza_time.py`.

## 2. Mad libs (short)

Write a mad libs that has input and output like this:

```
Welcome to Mad Libs!
Please enter the following words:
Noun: <person enters a noun>
Adjective: <person enters an adjective>
Noun: <person enters a noun
Character: <person enters a character>
Animal (Plural): <person enters an animal>
<noun1> sat on a <noun2>. <noun1> had a <adjective> fall. All <character>'s <animal> and all the <character>'s men couldn't put <noun1> together again.
```

The starter code is in `mad_libs_short.py`.

There is a test in `test_mad_libs.py` -- use the short test.

## 3. Mad libs (long)

Write a mad libs that has input and output like this:

```
Welcome to Mad Libs!
Please enter the following words:
Noun: <person enters noun>
Adjective: <person enters adjective>
Adjective: <person enters adjective>

Once upon a time a student at found themselves in a <noun1> class. The teacher was so <adjective> that the student started to daydream about a <noun2>. Then the student woke up and realized that they were still in class. The teacher was so <adjective2> that they gave the student a <number> on the assignment. The student was so <adjective3> that he <past-tense-verb> the class and went home to play <game>. The moral of the story is that you should never <verb2> in class.
```

The starter code is in `mad_libs.py`.

There is a test in `test_mad_libs.py`.

## 4. Write your own

Write your own interactive program in the file called `write_your_own.py`. Your
program should:

- Use `input()` exactly three times (EOF or EOFError means you called `input()`
  too many times)
- Use `print()` at least three times
- Use formatted strings

## Tests

Be sure you can pass the tests before you turn in the assignment. Review the
[guide on using pytest](/guide/unit3/using-pytest) if you need to review using
pytest and what to do if a test fails.

## Grading

| Activity         | Points              |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Pizza Time       | 5                   |
| Mad Libs (short) | 5                   |
| Mad Libs (long)  | 5                   |
| Write your own   | 5 (manually graded) |

Manual grading will focus on decomposition and use `input`, `print`, and formatted strings.
